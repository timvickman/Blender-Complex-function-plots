# Blender-Complex-function-plots
Add-on(s) for Blender, used to plot complex-valued functions as modular surfaces & real or imaginary Riemann surfaces.
As of right now, when typing a function you must use Python Syntax. The add-ons utilize the library *NumPy*, which is imported as 'np'. When typing specific functions, you have to append 'np.' before it [for example, 'ln(z)' = 'np.log(z)']. For a list of mathematical operations available with NumPy, see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html.
